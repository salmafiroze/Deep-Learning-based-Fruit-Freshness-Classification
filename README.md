We have be checked the performance of the MobileNetV2 model for fruit classification using two different optimizers: Adam and RMSprop. The goal is to evaluate which optimizer achieves the best accuracy and convergence speed during training. This comparison allows us to determine the most effective optimizer for optimizing the model's training process, ensuring optimal performance in classifying fruits based on images.

Skills and Tools: Python, Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras), Image Processsing, Model Evaluation
